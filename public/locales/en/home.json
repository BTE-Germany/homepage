Minecraft is the world's best-selling video game, with over 200 billion sales, and works much like a Lego box - but with an infinite number of bricks and an infinite amount of space. Build the Earth Germany is part of the <3>Build the Earth</3> project, which is active worldwide. With over {{builderCount}} people actively involved, BTE Germany is the second largest building team internationally."

It doesn't matter if you've just started building in Minecraft or are a long-time builder, we will be happy to help you and get you ready to build. We look forward to seeing you!"
